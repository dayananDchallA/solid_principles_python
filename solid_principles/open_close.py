'''
To adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) of the SOLID principles, you should structure your code so that it is open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without changing existing code.

You can achieve this by defining a base class for the data processing steps and then creating subclasses for each specific processing step. Hereâ€™s how you can refactor your code:

1. Define a base class for processing steps.
2. Create specific processing step classes that inherit from the base class.
3. Modify the process function to use these processing steps.
